_P.S. There are 2 notebooks on the GitHub - one with the final code, which was completely unable to run and save the output. That is, either the code was injured and the connection was lost, which did not allow saving the notebook. Or, the notebook was simply not runned to the end, and a memory error occurred during the execution of PCA and or clustering. The second notebook contains the code that was changed after the first review, so you can see what the output is. There was also an attempt to save the cleaned datasets before clustering, but with such an attempt, the workspace died, the entire output was deleted, and the workspace had to be restarted. All this only hindered the implementation of the project, and in no way contributed to the improvement of results._
